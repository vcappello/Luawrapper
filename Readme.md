# Luawrapper

A C++17 basic, header only, lightweight, non intrusive Lua wrapper. 
This library contains only a set of helper for simplify
the binding of variables, functions and classes to Lua, it is not a full Lua wrapper.
The library consists in a single header file, to use it simply include *Luawrapper.h*
in your project.
For bind C++ classes you don't need to add extra-code to your classes.
